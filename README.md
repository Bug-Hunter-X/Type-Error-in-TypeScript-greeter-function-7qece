This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a type error. The program defines a function that takes a string argument and returns a string. However, the program attempts to pass an array of strings to the function, which causes a type error. The solution demonstrates how to fix this error by either changing the type of the argument to an array of strings or modifying the logic to handle the array.
